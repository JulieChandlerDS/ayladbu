Chapter 1: The language destroyer and good guys
ALL YOUR ENGLISH ARE DESTROYED BY US
CATs blew up everything in sight. It was recommended for the Zero Wing committee to learn how to speak English, because all the other federations required it. It was hard for alien species to speak perfect English thanks to their brain and voicebox, and CATS was purposely trting to get rid of the language. CATS talks to his troops. Oh yeah, there was a survivor from Zero Wing, but no-one cared..


"Good evening gentlemen! I need plan to ruin english language!" CATs tells his troops.


"No good thought.. We can t think!" the troops reply.


Suddenly, an assassin that CATs hired enters the room.


"How you are?" CATs asks.


"I listen to plan.. I have idea! Great idea that can work!" the assassin says.


"What plan it?" CATs asks.


"We preserve body your in ice chamber make live longer! Future generation will suffer before chance!" The assassin tells CATs.


"Ha ha ha!" CATs and the assassin laugh.


"I fire you!" CATs replies.


"Open airlock troops, throw him out!" CATs replies.


The airlock is quickly open, and the troops toss out the assassin, then they close the airlock.


"Dead guy idea good! Use it!" CATs tells his troops.


The troops grab CATs and put him in a cold room, then they lock the door.

Centuries later, in the U.S.S. Enterprise


"Captain, I just found something very scary out!" the green skinned android guy says.


"Yes, what is it?" Captain Picard asks.


"The area we are in, is where the Zero Wing Committee was destroyed." the android tells the Captain.


"What is your point? I don t care about a history lesson." Captain Picard tells the android.


"Well, this area may be filled with pirates and such." the android replies.


Suddenly, a Black small space shuttle is seen on the vid-screen.


"Wait! Survivors of the wreck!" the android tells Picard.


The spine head dude looks at the object closely.


"That isn t a survivor of this region!" the spine head guy tells Picard.


"Quick, make communications with it!" Picard says.


*****


Somewhere far in space (that century):


A Zero-Wing space jet is floating, and a man is inside. He wakes up.


"Where I am?" the man says.


He looks at his clock on his spaceship and noticed centuries passed.


"Drugs of my! Them worked! Lived longer I!" the man says, realising he lived for centuries asleep.


"Zero-Wing base are belong to CATs at time. CATs ancestors own me base at this time?" the man asks.


*****


CATs s secret hide out:


CATs is let out of the room, then quickly defrosted.


"Welcome to our generation!" a scientist tells Cats.


"What you say?" Cats asks.


"You were locked in there for a couple of centuries, and your were frozen, but I quickly recovered you." the scientist tells Cats.


"Why weird speak not I?" Cats asks.


"What did you say?" the scientist asks.


"Why english perfect?" Cats asks.


"Well, all federations are required to speak perfect english. Now I must bring you to my home planet, you seem very special, like a peice of history." the scientist says.


*****


Back at the U.S.S. enterprise:


A vid screen opens, and suddenly, MR.T is shown!


"What are you doing here? This place is U.S.S. Federation Territory!" Picard tells Mr.T..


"Well, I was day-dreaming!" Mr.T tells Picard over the Vid-Screen..


"Captain.. If my history is correct, that looks like a van from the 1970s!" the android tells Picard.


"That s impossible, your circuits are fried! Go meet the guy who claims he was in another dimension where he could see and host a child s show "Reading Rainbow" and said we were on a T.V. show!" Picard tells the android.


"Yes sir." the android replies, then heads toward the engine room with the blind black engineer.


"Please explain what you are doing in this area!" Picard tells Mr.T


"Well, the A-Team fixed my van and made it capable of being a submarine. Then this guy named Allah was working in a Volcano with all these weird devices and meteors! It was my job to take that foo  Allah down, and ain t nothin wrong with that! Then suddenly, the Volcano was about to erupt, and the rest of the A-Team took all the helicopters. I quickly got in my van and locked the doors, just when the base of about to flow full of lava, suddenly, these machines and meteors explode, and the whole place turns dark and I fall asleep. Then I open my eyes, see that I m still in my van, but in a weird area! I found out this was space, and then-" Mr. T goes on and on.


"Okay, I understand. Now would you mind if we help you in anyway?" Picard asks.


"I want Icecream!" Mr. T tells Picard..


"I will rip him to shreads if he keeps fooling around, and then rip those shreads to smaller shreads." the spine headed says.


"Yo! Freak of nature! Ain t nobody talk to Mr. T like that!" Mr. T says.


******


Planet Nebuland:


CATs is in a space shuttle with the scientist, the shuttle is landing down in the planet s capitol soon.


"You ever want not use language english?" CATs asks.


"Yeah.. Alot of locals don t like the language.. Ever sense that stupid peace federation, everyone in the Galaxy has to speak English! In fact, a couple of centuries ago, anyone from Earth had to speak English when they went into Space. Nowadays everyone has to speak English PERFECTLY or the federation won t understand you. Sucks major ass." the scientist says.


"Why not destroy language english?" CATs asks.


"Well, its kind of impossible now. Even if we try to, the federation will be very suspicous." the scientist tells CATs.


The shuttle lands on the capitol of the Planet, the capitol is "Pie Ass Destrub."


"Have you leader at all?" CATs asks.


"No, we don t have a leader on this planet." the scientist says.


CATs smiles.


*****


Somewhere far in space (again):


The pilot doesn t have a name, and his ship has no full.


"What I do?" the pilot says to himself.


"Message must I make people hear!" the pilot says.


"ALL ALONE AM I!" the pilot screams!


******


To be continued:


Will the pilot of the Zero-Wing craft ever get saved or speak English properlly? Will Mr.T ever understand how he got in space and get his Ice Cream? Will Captain Picard ever report what happened to the U.S.S. federation? Will CATs make people speak incorrect english? And finally, what are the ingredients to those drugs that Zero-Wing pilot made!


Find out for some of these in the next episode of ALL YOUR ENGLISH ARE DESTROYED BY US!

U.S.S. Enterprise communications: DECK..


"What did you say!" the spine headed brown alien/guy yells .


"Foo ! You wanna fight with me! Cuss no-one wins against Mr.T!" Mr.T tells the Spine headed brown alien/guy.


"Do you know who I am! I m Wolf, head of this ship s offensive-" spine headed dude says, revealing his name as Wolf, before getting interupted.


"This is enough! I will not tolerated this! Go to your room!" Captain Picard tells the spine headed brown alien/guy/freak/WOLF.


"Yes sir.." the spine headed guy replies, then leaves the deck.


"Okay, we know your name is Mr.T.. State what kind of weapons you have on your craft!" Captain Picard says.


"I ve got torpedoes and that s about it!" Mr.T replies.


Suddenly, Captain Picard s sidekick, Commander Riker (the guy with the beard and stuff) enters the deck.


"Check it out! Some human from October 6th, 2003 asked his dad for my name!" Commander Riker replies.


"What?" Mr.T and Captain Picard asks.


"Nothing, now, lets check and see if you have any offense weapons on your craft!" Commander Riker says.


Some woman next to Riker checks Mr.T s ship.


"This ship seems to be very old, I can t check it! The only contact we can make with this ship is by communications." the woman says.


"Mr.T, do you mind if we investegate your ship? We understand you have no idea what we are doing. But the U.S.S. Enterprise is part of the U.S.S. federation." Captain Picard tells Mr.T..


"This ain t a ship! This is my van with sub-marine gear! And it goes hella fast!" Mr.T responds.

Commander Riker walks toward the pond.


"Beam me up Scottie!" Commander Riker says.


"Who the hell is Scottie?" the woman asks.


"Spok, don t you know of Scottie?" Commander Riker asks Captain Picard.


"You seem to have your history mixed up, this is the U.S.S. Enterprise, you are thinking of the last generation, just get your job done!" Captain Picard tells Riker.


"Oh alright.." Riker replies.


************


Planet Nebuland: capitol "Pie Ass Destrub"


The shuttle doors open, and the citizens watch the scientist and CATs walk out.


"Hurray, the scientist s rumors are true!" Citizens scream.. CATs and the scientist walk toward the debate tower and enter it. CATs is welcomed.


"Hello Gob Schneeedoor!" some debate people say to the scientist, revealing his name.


"Yeah yeah.. I get the idea.." Gob Schneeedoor replies (the scientist).


"Who is that guy next to you?" a fellow debater says.


"CATs my name!" CATs responds.


"He s not good at speaking English, but he makes good points." Gob Schneeedoor replies.


CATs doesn t like the fact everyone is speaking English perfectly.


"People ever not English speak?" CATs asks.


"Yes.. But this is the capital of the planet.. We all have to speak PERFECT English at this capital, follow me, I ll show you the debate room, a debate is about to start soon." Gob Schneeedoor tells CATs.


They walk up to an elevator door and it opens, quickly Gob Schneeedoor and CATs enter the elevator before the doors close.


"This may take a while, there are over 80 floors in this building." Gob Schneeedoor tells CATs..


Elevator music goes on..


"Music odd.. Why music soothing and silent? Music be loud!" CATs tells Gob Schneeedoor..


"Elevator music has always been like that.. Its for people who are afraid of heights and stuff.." Gob Schneeedoor replies.


**********


Back in space: the middle of nowhere..


"Full ship needs!" the pilot says.. Obviously mispelling and pronouncing "fuel"..


"Wait... Power Solar!" the pilot says, then hits a button and suddenly, the ship gains fuel by making solar panels rise..


"Am saved I!" the pilot says.


Suddenly, a big, grey, cube thing with lots of polls and wires is seen. And its gets bigger and bigger.


On board the big grey cube thing: deck..


Androids, cyborgs, and robots are seen.. In a crappy deck, very dark with pipers and metalic walls surrounding them. The captain quickly notices the vehicle..


"What the hell is that! Get me communications, now!" the captain, who is a cyborg yells.


a robot presses a button, and a vid-screen appears..


In that stupid Zero-Wing ship:


A vid-screen appears in front of the pilot, a very small vid-screen.


"Last communications at!" the pilot yells with happiness!


On board the big grey cube thing: deck (again)


"That motha ****** is huge boss!" an android yells to the captain.


"That thing has human flesh! No mechanical peices in it! Should we attack it because of flesh?" asks a robot.


"No.. I have flesh to you know.. He might be a cyborg like me.. But that creature is huge, all we can see is his belly on our vid-screen." the captain cyborg replies.


"Who are you! What is your species!" the cyborg yells at the vid-screen..


"Am name I not know!" the pilot of the Zero-Wing replies (except only you can see his belly jiggles on the vid-screen)..


"Sure.. That guy speaks horrible English! It could be possible that thing may be a android from a single century again that can communicate in all languages, but the dialogue gets messed up." a cyborg replies.


"Let me tells him.. OOHh alalal fudgetie tute so moi atie con moonca?" the captain asks in an unknown language.


"What you say?" the Zero-Wing pilot asks.


"You are wrong partner. He has no translator chip!" the captain tells the cyborg..


"Also, I said, Where is my dinner be-ach and who ate my candy?" the captain says to the vid-screen.


"Confuse am I is..." the Zero-Wing pilot replies (with his belly jiggling of course on the vid-screen)..

Mr.T s Van: Inside foo 


Commander Riker beams into Mr. T s van.. Suddenly, the A-Team theme plays.. Ba-ba baa ba-baaa, dum dum-dum-dum-DUUUM! Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba-ba bum! Ba- - (okay, I ll stop)


"Dang that s coo !" Mr.T says when he sees Commander Riker teleport in..


"Where are your torpedos?" Commander Riker asks.


"In the back foo !" Mr.T says..


Commander Riker walks behind all the chairs to the back of the van..


"Oh MY GOD!" Commander Riker yells in his little badge..


U.S.S. Enterprise: Deck


"What is it, does he have...  Weapons of mass destruction  in there?" Captain Picards asks.


Mr.T s Van foo 


"These torpedos are.. VERY OLD! I ve heard of these in history books about the centuries 1900 and 2000 AD!" Commander Riker says.


"What, they ain t good enough to take enemies out? I can beat em up my self usually! Why buy big expensive torpedos when I m gonna kick the enemies asses anyway!" Mr.T tells Commander Riker.


"You re in Space Mr.T, and besides that, you have no teleportation/beam equipment to fight your enemies in hand-to-hand combat!" Commander Riker says..


"That was way after the time the volcano erupted! I couldn t buy a single thing foo !" Mr. T tells Commander Riker.


Commander walks in the back and finds lots of big empty jugs of Milk!


"What the heck is with all these jugs?" Commander Riker asks.


"Foo ! I always drink my Milk! One of the reason s I m so strong besides my gold!" Mr.T responds.


"It turns out there are no deadly weapons on this ship... And it seems like Mr.T was telling the truth, believe it or not.." Commander Riker says to his stupid badge..


"Wait a second, how did you respond to our communications?" Commander Riker asks when he notices Mr.T doesn t have a vid-screen system.


"Foo ! I got myself a radio system, I just pick up my little radio speaker and talk! And on my radio system, I got a nice little T.V." Mr.T responds, pointing at the small T.V. on his radio system..


"Well, its against U.S.S. federation rules to allow someone to stay in space with little equipment, you seemed to have no milk or food left anymore.. Mr.T, can you drive your ship inside the shuttle room of the U.S.S. Enterprise?" Commander Riker asks.


"What s in it for me?" Mr.T asks.


"The icecream you wanted earlier I guess.." Commander Riker replies.


"Hell yeah! I ll go in there!" Mr.T responds.


On the very top of the U.S.S. Enterprise (the saucer part), a hatch opens.


"Watch this!" Mr.T responds.


Quickly, Mr.T s van drives into the hatch without a problem and the hatch closes.


U.S.S. Enterprise: Loading and Unloading Shuttle area..


Quickly, the doors of Mr.T s van open quickly..


"How did you do that so fast?" Commander Riker says.


"You might of not been at that place at the time on my T.V., so I ll repeat this line.. My van is hella fast!" Mr.T tells Commander Riker.


"Now where s my icecream foo ?" Mr.T asks Commander Riker.


********


Planet Nebuland: Capitol "Pie Ass Destrub"; in the debate tower..


"So, what were elevators like in your area?" Gob Schneeedoor asks.


"Would I lots of screaming hear! Blood over all walls! Music not exist, except dying people screams! Unsafe were elevators!" CATs tells Gob Schneeedoor..


Elevator doors open at the 90th floor, and a bunch of politicians are seen everywhere, they look at Gob Schneeedoor and CATs and they happen to be amazed..


"Gob Schneeedoor, it seems you were right about survivors in that area!" a politician says in exciting..


"Tell them your name.." Gob Schneeedoor says to CATs..


"CATs name my is.." CATs replies..


"What the! Did you hear him!" a politician replies in disgust..


"You don t understand, he s a good debater.. He makes excellent points! You can t judge someone because they can t speak English properly, and CATs is going to prove it! In fact, he has plans to do something about this "always speak English perfectly" thing.." Gob Schneeedoor replies..


"Now cates, walk behind that big tall desk-like structure with the microphone." Gob Schneeedoor tells CATs..


CATs walks behind the booth, and taps on the microphone.. Hundreds of politicians are looking at him..


**************


Back at that cube thing: deck


"What ever he is.. We need to get him in hear.." the cyborg captain tells his cadets..


"Oh bloody hell!" an android says..


"What ever your name is, please enter our ship! Its the cube like thing!" the cyborg captain yells in the vid-screen..


"Scam be might! I want not do go in! Bomb somebody set me up!" the Zero- Wing Pilot says (belly jiggling on the screen of course)


"I knew this would happen Captain, now give me some Crunch!" a cyborg says..


"I will not give you my crunch.. Now we need to capture that creature for analysis!" the captain cyborg says.


"Capture! NOOO! Hate capture I!" the Zero-Wing pilot yells..


"Send out the troops! Don t kill him! He ll make a good analysis!" the cyborg captain yells..


Space Arena: (in other words, I m to lazy to switch between ship every time)


Three garbage can ships fly out of the giant cube!


Suddenly, the Zero-Wing Pilot stops firing lasers..


"Captain, he s hostile!" an android pilot yells in his communication device.


"Damn it android friend! Don t let him escape! And don t fire! Use your hook-shot weapons, there the best non-lethal weapon available to sure capture the pilot!" the captain cyborg yells..


The first garbage can ship fire a hook, quickly, the Zero-Wing fighter fires lasers and destroys the hook.


"Ship 1 s hook is disable captain!" yells an android on the pilot deck..


Ships 2 & 3 fire their hooks, but the Zero-Wing fighter quickly fires at the weapons..


"Deploy the oil weapons, now!" the cyborg captain tells them..


"But sir, those are untested, it could help the enemy, or blow up the targetted ship if the pilots keeps try fire.." pilots of the garbage cans respond..


"Just do it!" the captain yells.. Then quickly he turns on his vid-screen to the Zero-Wing pilot..


"You have no idea who we are! We killed many pilots! And we are going to spare your life! Is this how you ll treat us? If you continually escape even after the oil weapons, we will quickly use this mother ship s torpedos immediately, destroying your ship to smithereens!" the cyborg captain yells.


"Freedom! Lie you are do!" the Zero-Wing pilot says (belly jiggling still)..


Quickly, the oil in big bags fly toward the Zero-Wing ship, then they hit the Zero-Wing fighter s weapon system..


"Can t lasers fire make!" the Zero-Wing pilot says.


Oil bags fly into the ships exhaust engine/boosters..


"Escape can not I do now! Must free I now, oil shake off!" the Zero-Wing pilot says..


"Sir, the tested weapons have succeeded!" the android says..


"Captain, he s about to commit suicide!" a cyborg yells..


"Listen! I have no idea where you can from! But we are not trying to kill you! If you continually try to fire at us with your weapon system jammed, the system will blow up killing you! Its up to you, give up and live.. Or keep trying to kill yourself and die!" the cyborg captain yells in the vid- screen..


Quickly, the Zero-Wing pilot quits.


"Up give I!" the Zero-Wing pilot says.


"Good, your life will be spared.." the cyborg captain says..


"Now your ship won t be damage, and we ll real you in!" the cyborg captain says.


Quickly, the garbage can ships fly toward the Zero-Wing fighter, attach to it like magnets, and fly towards the cube like ship..


*********


To be continued:


So, it turns out the U.S.S. Enterprise people and Mr.T have gotten along (well, except that spine headed guy Wulf/Wolf). CATs is being treated very well and can t speak English properly still. Plus, the Zero-Wing pilot has been captured by some cube like ship with androids (that are probally enemies of the U.S.S. Enterprise). But will Mr.T become a help to the U.S.S. Enterprise? What about CATs, will he destroy the English language and kill people? Finally, what will happen to that stupid Zero-Wing pilot? Find out next time on "All Your English Destroyed By Us."


End Note1: What the drugs the Zero-Wing pilot took will not be revealed for what it was made out of, we can claim it as magic or a small plot enabling device.


End Note2: I urge you to get any fans of Mr.T and Star Trek who like fanfiction on to read this.. I can not copy this as the rules say into the Mr.T and Star Trek sections of .. I just happened to put it in Zero-Wing because CATs is the main villian..

"I mean it - she was the most realistic simulation I ve seen since Minuet."

Riker s eyes were bright as he recalled the earlier test of the Enterprise-E s holodeck that he, Data, Troi, and Geordi had conducted at a jazz bar. Even Worf had come along, after his protests were dismissed by Troi pointing out that the reason for his visit from Deep Space 9 was to see the new ship. They had decided to cap the night off with an inaugural poker game in Riker s quarters, which quickly became controlled by his and Data s rapidly growing chip stacks.

Geordi tossed two cards into the center of the table. "You re just saying that because she could actually pretend to put up with your bluster."

"I m shocked - shocked, Geordi, that you doubt her interest was genuine."

"It was not genuine, Commander." Data flicked two cards neatly into Geordi s waiting hands. "She was merely a holographic representation of a female patron of the establishment and any interest she may have demonstrated was the result of a computer simulation." He considered for a moment, then continued. "The fact that she did appear to have an interest in your unsubtle advances may in fact demonstrate a flaw in the holodeck programming of the new Enterprise."

Troi and Geordi stifled their laughter, and even Worf looked amused, in his own way. Data was pleased - it had been 439 days since the installation of the emotion chip, but he was still not completely confident in his ability to determine the appropriateness of humor at the expense of someone else.

"Yeah, okay. But come on, you guys gotta admit, this was one of the best holodeck programs we ve seen in a while, right? I mean, she was stunning." He turned to Geordi for confirmation. "Right?"

Geordi looked at his new cards. "She was something, all right," he replied noncommittally as he toyed with his chips, waiting for Troi to make her bet.

"Twenty," she said, and tossed two chips into the pile.

Riker quickly called. "What d you think of her, Worf?"

"She was much too small a mate for a Klingon." He scowled at his hand and the growing pile of chips in turn, then slapped his cards onto the table. "Fold."

"You guys are killing me. What about you, Data?"

"Sir?"

"What did you think of her? I mean, correct me if I m wrong, but I d just assumed that since you got the emotion chip you d..." He made a vague hand gesture. "...be able to experience sexual attraction."

Geordi raised a disbelieving eyebrow, but failed to seem surprised at Riker s forwardness. "Call."

Data felt an odd sense of embarrassment - an emotion he had experienced much less frequently than many others. He considered whether or not he should avoid the subject Riker had brought up, as many humans would choose to do. But then, was it not a common human bonding experience to discuss one s romantic life? Though was it also not common for humans to stop short of discussing more intimate details?

After 27 microseconds seconds of consideration, Data decided to match Riker s forwardness. "Indeed you are correct, Commander. However, thus far it has only been directed toward male members of humanoid species. Consequently I felt nothing for her. Dealer folds."

There was an awkward silence while Riker, Troi and Geordi exchanged glances.

Geordi turned slightly in his seat to look at him. "Data, do you mean to... Are you telling us you re... gay?"

Data accessed his language databases. "In my understanding of the most common usage of the term, yes, I believe that may be accurate."

Another pause.

"And this, uh..." Riker scratched at his beard as he leaned forward, brow furrowed. "This is because of the chip? Because of a bit of programming?"

"It would appear so. Dr. Soong was meticulous in his creation of the chip. I do not doubt that he would have taken my sexuality program into consideration while constructing it."

"But Lore got hold of it before you did, right? Is it possible that he tampered with it?" Troi sharply jabbed her elbow into Riker s arm at this.

"No. Geordi and I saw no evidence of damage to the chip other than what was caused when I was forced to fire a phaser at Lore." The usual unbidden conflicting emotions that arose when the death of his brother was brought up began to flood his mind. The subject had proven to be the greatest obstacle in his attempts to fully integrate emotions into his life, and was still capable of causing great distress. Counselor Troi had assured him this was to be expected of anyone who had experienced what he had and advised him to not simply turn off the chip when it became a problem, saying only time would allow him to fully heal.

Accordingly, he allowed the emotions to continue to process in the background and continued. "You seem to imply that the emotional expression of my sexuality program may be a defect of some kind in the chip. I do not understand why this would be so."

Riker opened and closed his mouth a few times as he appeared to search for words. Worf interrupted anything he would have said, however, as he straightened his back and appeared to enter what Geordi had once called his Pompous Klingon mode. At the time Data had failed to understand the joke; however, upon reviewing similar instances from the past he now believed he could see the appropriateness of the appellation.

"Could you not alter the program?" The Pompous Klingon mode was accompanied by this particular grumbling voice in 87.4% of occurrences, and nearly always coincided with an assertion of the proper Klingon way of conducting one s affairs.

Data was beginning to see a problem. "Why should I wish to do so?"

"Because it is not... normal."

Another silence descended upon the table. Data noted that Geordi continued to appear to devote his attention to stacking his chips in various patterns, his jaw clenched. Troi looked at a loss for words, and Riker widened his eyes by nine percent as he thought out loud.

"Wouldn t say it s not normal... Unusual, maybe..."

This seemed to be the wrong thing to say. Geordi s stack of chips collapsed and he looked up sharply. "Now wait a-"

Troi smacked Riker s arm with the back of her hand this time. "Will!"

"Please," Data interrupted, and they all stared at him. He found the effect was somewhat off-putting. "This appears to have made you uncomfortable in some way. I had not spared much thought to the implications of this particular manifestation of my emotional programming. I was unaware that it would be cause for concern. In fact, I was given to understand that homosexuality began to become destigmatized in human society during the period after Earth s third World War, shortly prior to the founding of the Federation. Is this not accurate?"

"Yes, Data, it is." Troi said this as much to Riker as to Data.

Riker raised his hands in a placating gesture. "Yeah, definitely, it s just... uncommon. And, well... What about Tasha? And Jenna?"

"Those relationships are not relevant, as they occurred prior to the installation of the emotion chip. My actions with Tasha were the result of a sexuality program that lacked the direction that the emotion chip now provides for it. My relationship with Jenna was governed by a program I had to specifically create for her. One could liken it to the conditioning of the humanoid mind to produce an expected response upon encountering certain stimuli. It is not a native response to the individual."

Anger was the first emotion Data had ever felt, and aside from humor was the one he had spent the most time analyzing. During his sessions with Troi following the last encounter with Lore, she had raised the possibility that he would not be able to fully understand everything that had occurred if he was unable to experience the associated emotions. It was a large factor in his decision to finally install the chip. He had used the majority of the shore leave he had been granted after the destruction of the Enterprise-D to attempt to come to terms with the events, and consequently he had had to relive several distinct varieties of negative emotions.

He occasionally felt a twinge of regret that anger was the emotion with which he was most familiar. Data knew that Troi harbored a quiet yet profound sympathy for this, and was grateful.

At this moment, however, the emotional state he was experiencing was a novel one. It contained the sixteenth type of anger that he had identified, but also the third confusion, eleventh fear, a small amount of the eighth variety of sadness, and an overwhelming desire to voice every thought that came to mind on the subject. He would need to speak with Counselor Troi about this, but for the moment he followed what they had agreed would be the best course and let the emotions take him where they would.

"To my knowledge," he continued in a coolly logical tone before anyone could respond to his analogy, "there are 28 same-sex couples aboard the Enterprise. Of these, seven are interspecies relationships. It is not an uncommon phenomenon. I do not understand why you are more concerned with my apparent sexuality than you are with theirs."

The poker game seemed forgotten. "Further, I believe it must be pointed out that my gender was itself essentially an arbitrary decision on the part of Dr. Soong. He and my mother argued over the matter until he simply crafted my head in his image. In fact, one could say that this is true for any aspect of my personality. For example, while I am in all practical aspects ambidextrous, I do favor my left hand for simple tasks such as painting. This is not a conscious choice or a spontaneously generated piece of code. It was a decision that Dr. Soong must have at some point purposefully made while he was creating me."

Riker let out an uncomfortable laugh. "Maybe we should call it a night before you end up having an existential crisis."

"On the contrary, Commander. I am quite comfortable with my identity. I am Noonien Soong s son." Data paused momentarily as he considered how best to help the others understand. "My original programming is not unlike the genome that humanoid children inherit from their parents. My subsequent enhancement of that programming is simply the child maturing as it learns how to interact with the world around it.

"You will note, for example, that I often include short pauses in my speech when I am engaged in casual conversation. I have found that affectations such as these add nuance and connotation to speech that is beyond the simple meaning of the words. While in reality it may only take me 12 nanoseconds to determine the most appropriate word for the occasion, I may show hesitation in order to convey the complexity of the situation. This was not part of my original language programming, but rather came out of several years of observation and experience."

It had been a long while since Data had spoken largely uninterrupted for such a lengthy period of time outside of a staff meeting or a theatrical performance - not, in fact, since consulting with Troi about Lore s death and his first brush with emotion. He wondered what it meant that the others had remained silent except for Riker s attempt at a joke.

"In contrast, the program that I wrote for Lieutenant D Sora was not the result of this normal growth pattern. It was written out of necessity rather than growing organically, so to speak, and was subsequently deleted. It has no more relevance to my current operation than would any other learning experience for what not to do.

"While it would theoretically be possible to alter the sexuality expression of the emotion chip, to do so would fundamentally alter the programming that my father laid down for me. I would essentially be changing my genome for no purpose other than to be more  normal. " He glanced at Worf. "I am not a conventional lifeform. I see no reason to attempt to alter myself in this respect so that I may experience commonality."

The subject of the D Sora program had raised the memory of the argument he had attempted to engage her in. The program he had written included a provision for "storming out" when one was finished with a heated discussion, and since then Data had been fascinated by the idea but had never found an opportunity to attempt it himself. His observations led him to believe that this would be an ideal occasion, and, if he correctly understood the idea behind it, would serve to finalize his argument.

He rose, neatly stacking his cards and chips and pushing them to the center of the table. "I believe I have said everything there is to be said with regards to my sexuality program. If you still find yourself confused, I suggest you converse with Counselor Troi. I must attend to an experiment in the biometrics lab. Excuse me."

If Data had been unsure whether Troi would mind being used in such a manner, the quickly suppressed amused smile that crossed her face as he left would have told him all he needed to know.

10.7 hours after leaving Commander Riker s quarters, Data entered Counselor Troi s. Her eyes brightened when she saw him.

"Hi, Data. I have a feeling I know what you re here to talk about." She gestured to the sofa next to her. "Come in, sit down."

"If you are referring to the incident during the poker game last night, you are correct," he began, taking his usual place at the end of the couch. "I have several concerns I wish to discuss."

Troi s smile faded, but she retained the ghost of it she often held when counseling someone. "Such as?"

"Primarily, my attempt to make the others understand my feelings on the matter of my sexuality program. I believe I may have...  laid it on too thick. "

Her brow furrowed slightly. "In what way?"

"I am concerned that my actions may be perceived as ranting at Commander Riker and Worf. I had not intended to do so, and I feel as though I must apologize." He blinked. "I find, however, that part of me does not wish to apologize."

"Then don t."

Data blinked again. "Counselor?"

Troi leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. "Data, you did nothing wrong. You reacted exactly as I would expect someone whose identity was unfairly questioned to react."

"Unfairly questioned?" He reviewed the conversation to determine what she most likely meant. "Are you referring to Commander Riker inquiring if Lore had tampered with the emotion chip, or Worf s suggestion that I alter the program due to its abnormality?"

"Both." Troi sighed. "See, Data, it s true that now most humans don t care one way or another about other people s sexualities, but some wounds of the Eugenics Wars are harder to heal than others. And some cultures are still somewhat hesitant about it." She smiled wryly. "Sometimes Worf has a tendency to forget that what s important for Klingons isn t important for everyone else. Either statement on its own would have been enough to make anybody angry, and I certainly can t imagine either of them saying those things to any other gay member of their crews."

"You suggest that they reacted the way they did because I am not human."

"Mostly I think they just have a hard time understanding why Dr. Soong would have deliberately programmed your emotion chip to make you attracted to other men."

Data nodded slowly, considering this. "My father did have an unusual way of looking at things. I do not doubt that he would find this situation most amusing. But I am what he made me, and I accept that."

"Exactly." She leaned back in her chair and settled in more comfortably. "The people that we re attracted to is a great part of what makes us who we are. It was natural for you to want to defend yourself. A perceived personal attack can easily be interpreted as though it were a physical threat, and reacted to just as aggressively."

"I believe I understand. Shortly after Worf s suggestion that I alter the program, I began to experience a novel confluence of emotion consisting of 72.3% anger, 16.1% confusion, 7.8% sadness and 3.8% fear. I also felt a compulsion to express every thought on the subject that came to mind."

"I ve never heard righteous indignation described quite so precisely before."

"I could tell you precisely which types of those emotions I experienced."

Troi let out a small laugh. "No, thank you Data, I think I get the picture."

"As you wish." Another detail occurred to him. "I believe that the mention of Lore may have precipitated my... rant."

"That was the most civil rant I ve ever heard, Data." Her face softened. "But it s understandable. I know that thinking about Lore isn t easy for you. It s to be expected that someone in an already emotionally fragile state would react more easily to something like that."

"It is normal for the subject of Lore to evoke several strong emotions, and this occasion was not an exception. I followed your advice and allowed the emotions to continue, and looking back, it felt as though this served to...  feed  the anger I felt. I believe it did not help that I subsequently began to consider my past experiences with anger."

"Which naturally brought you back to Lore."

"Yes."

Troi sighed again and moved to join Data on the couch. "I wish I could tell you that it will get easier, Data. You experienced a sort of trauma that most people can t even begin to imagine, and it s going to be a sore point for a very long time. But you seemed able to keep calm, so I d say you re making progress."

Data recalled the first time he had thought about Lore after the installation of the chip. It had been... unpleasant. "I agree. Thank you, Counselor."

"I m glad to help. So," she clapped her hands on her thighs and smiled wickedly. "Are you going to tell me just how you discovered your attraction to men in the first place?"

As Data observed Geordi constructing a model of the original United States schooner Enterprise to replace the one lost during the crash on Veridian III, he believed he was beginning to understand the appeal of crafting such objects by hand rather than simply replicating them. Geordi sat cross-legged on the floor of his quarters, surrounded by assorted miniaturized pieces of wood and rope and appeared to have no worldly concerns at all.

"I think his exact words were  I m such an ass.  Hand me that flag, will you?"

Data joined him on the floor and passed over the indicated replica flag. "Counselor Troi did suggest that Commander Riker s later silence was indicative of his embarrassment at his initial reaction."

"Then he stared off at your pile of chips for a second and said something like,  he just stormed out on us, didn t he?  and laughed. He loved it. I don t think you ve ever been more human to him than in that moment."

"Counselor Troi was similarly delighted. She said she was proud of the manner in which I ended the conversation while making clear what I thought of their reactions."

Geordi picked up what appeared to be the final piece of rigging. "Oh, you made it clear all right. Worf seemed worried that his honor would be tainted or something if he didn t get to apologize to you before he had to go back to DS9."

Data chose to forgo the obvious response regarding Worf s subsequent apology to him in the biometrics lab. The topic seemed to be a conversational dead end, as it were, and he found he wanted to raise another subject. "She also expressed amusement at my response when she inquired how I discovered my attraction to men."

"Oh yeah?" Geordi appeared distracted by the delicate operation of attaching the rigging to the mast.

"Yes. I am curious: do you also find it amusing that during my early exploration of emotion I watched several erotic holofilms in addition to the usual dramatic fare?"

Geordi s hand slipped and a yardarm swayed dangerously. He blinked rapidly - an expression of surprise still novel given that his ocular implants were only 63 days old - and steadied the yardarm. "Erotic holofilms?"

"Over the course of fourteen days I watched 382 films, seventeen of which were erotic in nature. 99.83% of all instances of sexual response were due to male humanoids."

Geordi cleared his throat as he ran a hand over his head. "What was the outlier?"

"A human female who bore an unfortunate resemblance to Tasha. I believe the response was caused by the sympathetic memory of our time together, as I do not experience attraction when I think of her. There is love, but only that for a lost friend." He had not finished that film.

"I m sorry, Data."

"Do not be. Among other things, it serves as an excellent example to me of the varying degrees of intersection - or lack thereof - between lust and love." He resumed the original course of the conversation. "Did you find my approach amusing?"

"Well..." Geordi resumed his attempt to rig the ship. "It s certainly... strange to think of you watching those things. But it s a reasonable thing to do, I suppose."

"I believe Counselor Troi was primarily amused by the immediate mental image she said she formed of me taking copious notes and calculating exact angles and forces. I confess, prior to the installation of the chip this was precisely my method of exploring various facets of sexuality."

Geordi smiled and bit back a laugh. "So what are you going to do now?"

"I do not know. I find I am at a loss as to how to proceed with intimate relationships. I do not even know how best to determine whether a potential partner would be interested in such a relationship."

"Ah, I know how you feel."

"In what way?"

"Well, I mean, just because I ve never had a relationship with a man doesn t mean the interest isn t there." Geordi finished attaching the rigging and the yardarm hung securely in its place. He leaned back, satisfied. "It s just... I m awkward enough with relationships already, it s easier to try it without the added insecurity of whether or not they re even into men. And I ve never really had anyone I felt motivated enough to get over that for."

"You suggest you would attempt to engage in a relationship with a male if you knew beforehand that his sexual orientation would not preclude it."

"Well... yeah."

"I see."

They were silent. Geordi stretched out his legs and grimaced. "Dammit, my leg s gone asleep."

"I have told you several times that it is not possible for an extremity to enter a semi-conscious somniative state."

"Now look-" Geordi glanced up from rubbing his calf.

Data just smiled at him.
Los Angeles, 1985

I hit the ground. The unexpected, hard landing knocked the wind out of me, and I felt the gravel from the street dig into my palms. The left side of my face burned like hell after the punch I had just received. It hurt. But knowing that my best friend had knocked me to the ground hurt much more. He was the one whose help, support and understanding I could rely on and whom I trusted. Someone who always held me when I was scared or desperate; who led me through the darkness of my life. Someone I had loved for years.

I looked up, saw the shock written on his face from what he had just done. He shifted his weight nervously, and after a brief hesitation he held out his hand offering me help.

I felt one of the sharp stones dig between my ribs as I moved. With a hiss, I turned away from him to get up, as painlessly as possible. And when I glanced at him again, the helping hand was gone. He held it pressed to his stomach, stroked the delicate fabric of his expensive shirt automatically. So I picked myself up slowly. In an effort to be as far away from him as possible, I pressed my back against the wall of the house behind me. But I couldn't stop staring into his eyes. I could read embarrassment there. Guilt. Regret. But also anger, and worst of all, a silent but very clear reproach.

He reached out again, taking a few steps towards me, but I pressed against the wall even more.

"Stay away from me!" I yelled at him. "Stay where you are! I. I don't want this!"

He stopped, disconcerted; and his blue eyes turned to pieces of ice in a heartbeat.

"And you think I wanted you to become a traitor? What did you think, Murdock?"

"I'm not a traitor! I wanted to protect you! It was all for your own good, Face!"

"So for my own good, huh? How do you even know what's good for me? You know, I always thought you were on my side, but you-"

"I am on your side!"

"Oh, sure. As soon as I let you out of my sight, you turn your back on me!"

My hands hidden in my pants pockets clenched into fists. That hurt. It hurt more than he could have imagined. I took a breath, pulled one hand out of the pocket, and rubbed my burning face.

"I didn't want her to hurt you again. I thought if you didn't see her, if you never met her again in your life, it would be better for you. You told me yourself when I asked you. And I asked, remember? I wasn't talking about me, it was about you. I wanted to know what you would do if someone hurt you, and then reappeared in your life. And you said you wouldn't want to see the person. That's what I was going on! I was just doing what you told me to do! I protected you!"

"I thought we were talking about you!"

"And what's the difference? Are the rules different for you than for me? How do I know what's right and what's wrong then? I thought you were advising me at your best discretion!"

"You aren't me! You're-"

"Crazy? Is that what you meant?"

"Different! You are different."

"How different? You mean that I can't cope with my problems and have to hide myself from them? So I'm not supposed to see a person who hurt me, while you're strong enough to march in front of the woman who broke your heart years ago, made you leave college and join the army? The woman who made you never really love anyone else 'cause you're afraid that someone could hurt you again? Don't you remember how bad you felt when she showed up in your life again? I didn't give you the message she left here 'cause I didn't want to see you like that again!"

"How can you say that, Murdock! How can you-"

"I can't! Get away from me, I'm not strong enough to see people who hurt me!" I turned, walked away from him quickly. My eyes burned uncomfortably, tears threatened to spill over.

"Murdock, wait! I never said that!"

I pretended not to hear him. I didn't want to argue with him. Didn't want to scream at him or hear him yell at me. I hated fighting with him. BA and I could shout ourselves hoarse at each other and I didn't mind 'cause it was always a game. 'Cause I knew the Big Guy never meant it. Or at least I thought he didn't. But Face. it hurt to fight with him. It hurt so bad.

He called my name again, but I didn't turn to him. Instead, I turned the corner of the house, ran across the parking lot, and jumped into BA's van which was waiting there quietly. I slammed the door shut behind me.

"Problem, Captain?"

Hannibal looked up from the newspaper he had been reading.

"I wanna go home!"

The Colonel just raised an eyebrow, but BA turned sharply, giving me a piercing look.

"I ain't goin' to drive you from one place to another and back, fool. You wanna go here and in half an hour you wanna go there. Take a cab, man."

"Easy, BA." Hannibal put a hand on BA's arm to calm his temper. "Murdock, what's going on? I thought you were looking forward to the weekend outside the VA. You wanted to go to the fair with Face, didn't you?"

I crossed my arms over my chest, and with bowed head, I said firmly, "I wanna go to the VA. We're done here, so I should be back anyway."

Hannibal fished a cigar out of his pocket, took a breath, but before he could speak something in his peripheral vision caught his attention. He looked out the window, watching in silence as Face got in his Vette two parking spaces away and disappeared in the smoke of his squealing tires. Hannibal looked back at me questioningly, but I turned my head away.

"BA, go to Murdock's hospital," he finally said.

"Hannibal, don't get him used to it. If that fool starts to think I'm gonna dance to his tune, then he."

The Colonel sqeezed BA's shoulder, silencing him. BA just shook his head, muttered something quietly, and started the van.

I settled more comfortably, rubbed my face again. It didn't burn anymore. I'd suffered worse in my life, anyway. Some wounds took several weeks to heal up. This was just a tickle. Yet it had hurt the most in recent years.

I sensed Hannibal was watching me. You gotta get used to that sharp, inquisitive look when you wanna work in Colonel Smith's unit. Usually he doesn't miss anything, tries very hard to see and know everything. He examines you, explores you, observes you, and compares your every move and gesture with his mental databank. He's very good at it. Sometimes too good.

I closed my eyes, rested my head on the backrest. It was clear I couldn't fool him. He knew very well that I wasn't asleep. But he got it, asking no more questions. Just smoked his cigar thoughtfully, ignoring BA's frowning glances visible in the rearview mirror.

They both knew it. They knew something had happened. But neither of them asked me any more. I really didn't want to talk about it. I didn't even want to think about it. I wanted to forget.
A/N: This is me at about midnight, sleep-deprived, inspired to write about our dear English-challenged friend, Cats. He is indeed a special individual, and deserves a special story.

Once upon a time, Cats got bored doing whatever he does for a living, commanding his minions around in broken English and whatnot. So, he decided to fly his battleship to my planet, namely the humble planet of Muffin. We are a peaceful people on the planet Muffin. Well, except for the Random Acts of Randomness, but more about those later.

When he reached planet Muffin, he was greeted with a warm welcome from our tribe, the lazy-yet-widely-feared Butternut tribe.

"Nnnganahh-ehhhhhhh! Jinnntoh-ehhh-ee-ehhhh!" said our tribal chief, who was known only as Dances With Penguins. (Translation: Welcome, oddly-dressed stranger! We greet thee, oh other-worldly being!) Cats replied in the most intelligent way he could think to.

"All your base are belong to us! You have no chance to survive make your time - I mean, I are not invader of your crib. Peace, my dawg." Cats had been picking up cheesy radio signals from Earth lately that interfered with his Engrish communicator.

We stared at him with perplexed expressions on our faces. Not quite understanding what had just come out of this strange visitor s mouth, we embraced him with loving arms.

"Shayaaaaaaa-shangehhhhhhh! Machii-maki-maki-ohhh!" we cried out in unison. (Translation: We shall now perform the sacred shanking ritual! To the Shanking Grounds!) We carried him off on our shoulders to the sacred Shanking Grounds of the Ancients. When we reached our destination, we set Cats down on the ground and yanked his pants down.

"Ow!" cried Cats, not expecting to have his chili pepper-print boxers exposed so early on in his visit. "What you do?"

"Rrrrrrrrringatchi-ennnn, ohmah!" said Dances With Penguins. (Translation: Now let us celebrate the arrival of our new king!)

"Krrrakii-ehhh! Duumu-teppii-doh!" I yelled. (Translation: Woo-hoo! Let s party, y all!)

We all carried Cats, our new king, off to our Giant Party Tiki Hut. Why did we choose him as our new king, you may ask? Because we wanted to, that s why. You see, this was one of our Random Acts of Randomness. So, we all drank pineapple-mango juice and danced to repetitive-yet-addictive techno music all night long. At the end of the celebration, we crowned Cats with his new crown, initiating him in as our new king, and presented him with his new tribal name, Maximum Tomato. Sadly, he had to leave us the next morning to continue his quest to conquer the universe. Nevertheless, Planet Muffin will never forget our beloved and eternal ruler, Cats the Great.
A/N: If this was a little to bizarre for you, it s because I was very tired when I wrote this, yet I still felt that I needed to pay tribute to Cats. Review if you wish, and happy reading as always.
